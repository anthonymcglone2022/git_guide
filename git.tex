\section{What is git?}
git is a repository (or store) which is used to store files. git "versions" the files in the repository, so every time a commit (or save) operation is made, the state of the files in that repository is saved (with a unique ID). This means that you can see the history of the changes in the repository. You can also delete the changes in the repository by going back to a specific commit. Git is mostly used by Software Engineers to store and version code for software releases. It's a powerful tool for collaboration on large projects. This guide will demonstrate how the git command line tool is used to manage a repository.
